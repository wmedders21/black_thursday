# Black Thursday

- A business is only as smart as its data. Letâ€™s build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

## Learning Goals

- Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
- Decompose a large application into components
- Design a solution that is functional, readable, maintainable, and testable
- Learn an agile approach to building software

## Getting Started
- One team member forks the repository here and adds the other(s) as collaborators.
- Everyone on the team clones the repository
- Setup SimpleCov to monitor test coverage along the way
- Setup Hound CI
- Spec Harness
- This project will be assessed with the help of a spec harness. - The README.md file includes instructions for setup and usage. Note that the spec harness is not a replacement for your own test suite.
